  "description": "<p>Go is a small language, but one with a few differences to many common languages. For example, Go supports an Object Oriented style of development, but doesn't have classes, and it has built-in primitives to simplify concurrent programming.</p> <p>This workshop is aimed at introducing these concepts to someone new to Go, but not new to programming in general. </p> <p>Feel welcome to drop by on March 24th at Devhouse Spindle, located in The Big Building. We’ll start at 7:30 PM and of course there will be drinks and snacks to keep you concentrated ;) Hope to see you there!</p> ",
